        <h2><p style="color:crimson";>About Me</p></h2>
        <p>Hello There!</p>
        My name is Jaiden Santos I am incredibly interested in furthering the development of the Cybersecurity field.
        I aspire to be well knoweledged in many fields of study, regarding computer sciences
        especially Cyber Security. I aspire to create technological advancements in the industry and focus my expertise towards high class automotive security systems.
        I was born and raised in Yokohama japan, where i lived the first 10 years of my life, before moving to america. I was always interested in technology
        and as i grew older my interest in its inner workings, grew further.</p>

      <p>When i was in high school, i didnt really know what i wanted to do when i got out, i didnt think about it much either
      Though when christmas came around in my freshman year, i had gotten a desktop pc that i really wanted.
      On numerous occasions i would take it apart, and study each indiviual component, while a detailed youtube video was on in the background.
        I would then put it back together with a new understanding for the way it worked. This was the start of my newly founded passion for the technological field.
        I would do this on multiple occasions, and would also spend any money i came across upgrading the parts and bits, as i understood more and more.
        Due to my small love for video games, i was also interested in many of the things that came with it when playing on the desktop pc.
        Things like network connectivity, ping, and fps were things that interested me, figuring out ways to make the games run smoother, or for things to,
        download quicker, all of these things strived me to learn more and more.</p>

        <p>Im not the most knowelegable when it comes to coding, and areas of technological infrastructure, but with the growing field, and it being,
        apart of my passion, its ideal to me that i pursue it as my future career. I was never a coder in highschool, and nor do i plan to create large codes for game or web design.
        I was merely introduced to the world of coding from my college courses as they were required to pursue a cybersecurity career path. With that being said, it
        has become something i quite enjoy, figuring out problems whilst getting a greater understanding for the architecture. With my plan, to further the high
        end automotive security field, i could only see coding skills becoming a great thing to rely on. </p>
